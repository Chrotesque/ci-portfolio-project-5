# **WIP** ([^](#table-of-contents))
### As this project is still a work in progress, it's feature incomplete:
- task display is only possible through url manipulation and knowing id's of existing tasks
- task creation is possible
- comments, profile displays as well as categories are not implemented
- tasks are visible to all users, which will go back to required changes to the API
- styling in general, the Code Institute module "moments" has been used as basis for development and is still present in lots of places
- syntax / style checking quite possibly incomplete, focus was on this during development but certain style errors might have slipped my attention
- whatever else unforeseen issue exists
- this readme is incomplete as a result of the aforementioned
